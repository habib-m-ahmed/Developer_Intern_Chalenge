# Shopify_Developer_Intern_Challenge
This repository is for the Shopify Winter 2022 Developer Intern Challenge!

<p>A store owner has the ability to sell their paintings to customers but only if they have the required stock. 
<p>The application is made with flask and sqlite3 which allows the user to buy and sell images at a certain price. Furthermore, you can add new products and edit/remove existing items in the shop. There is a database implemented in the backend to store all the images.
<p>To run the application, flask and sqlite3 are required to be installed on your system if they are already not. Next, run the main.py file using the command: python main.py. This will host a web application at the following address (unless stated otherwise in the terminal): http://127.0.0.1:5000/. Lastly, go to your internet browswer and search up the address mentioned previously to access the store!
